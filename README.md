Application Requirements: 

1. Using one of the libraries/framework listed above, build a screen which shows a list of hour long slots from 9am to 5pm. 

2. When one time slot is clicked, load details screen (another page/screen) which asks for first name, last name and phone number. Screen will have 2 options - Cancel and Save. 

3. When the name and phone number is submitted/saved, the app should be redirected back to the main screen and the selected time slot should change to red, indicating the time slot is no longer available. 

4. If the red time slot is clicked on again, redirect again to the details screen with the name and phone number for that appointment pre-populated. Users will be able to edit the name and phone number to change the user for the appointment. Donâ€™t worry about credentials. Any user can update any timeslot, irrespective, it is booked by the same user or not. 

5. Showcase the use of Redux or other state management libraries.
